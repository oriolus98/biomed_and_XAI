# Classification of polysomnographic data
Final assignment for my course on Biomedics Data Science applications, with collaboration of my colleague Sergio Conde. 

The main goal was the feature extraction from different temporal series, training a classifier (Random Forest) maximizing precission as a clinical requirement, and developing the explainability of our model using Shapley values.
Our work follows the publication ['ISRUC-Sleep: A comprehensive public dataset for sleep researchers'](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26589468/). We used data from 10 healthy subjects, which can be found on subgroup 3 [here](https://sleeptight.isr.uc.pt/?page_id=48).
We used the specialized library [YASA](https://raphaelvallat.com/yasa/build/html/index.html) for feature extraction.
